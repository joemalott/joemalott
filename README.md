# joetheme
The WordPress theme for my personal portfolio page, http://joemalott.com for the curious.

This theme isn't anything special, and highly specific. I started it from scratch, no _s headstart, as I like my themes to be as lean as possible. My philosophy is that WordPress works best as a CMS when it is involved as little as possible.
